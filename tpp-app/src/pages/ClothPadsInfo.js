        Storytime: here comes your period - reusable cloth pads are a great period product option!

        Cloth pads originated as cloth rags dating back to the 10th century in Ancient Greece. Now they
        are made of cotton, an absorbent, leak-proof material such as “Zorb,” Polyurethane Laminate (a
        plastic-like material for the pad’s backing), or amazing bamboo or organic cotton. Most of them 
        have snaps to secure the pad in place, like a pad with wings.

        You need about five cloth pads to wash and use throughout your cycle. They are also a financial
        investment (around $100 for 5), but cloth pads will last for 2-3 years, depending on personal 
        usage and care.
